            >front-end development</a
          >, data storytelling or creative learning development. Our work &
          learn tracks make you highly attractive to employers. Youâ€™ll invest in
          a range of skills that help you grow and continue growing - in your
          work and in your personal life. And you even get paid for it.
        </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Learn to Work. Work to learn.</h3>
        <p>
          In some tracks youâ€™ll start with a base training, which - in some
          cases - you can do alongside your work or studies. This makes it
          easier to take the jump and at the end of it, youâ€™ll land on a solid
          foundation of skills.
        </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ on the road to discovery.</h3>
        <p>
          In the first period, youâ€™ll be working with a real team on real
          project assignments. Youâ€™ll be supported by instructors and graduates.
          This is your opportunity to discover if this track is something for
          you.
        </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ Look back to stay ahead.</h3>
        <p>
          During this period, we evaluate together. If this road turns out to
          not be for you, no worries. There are no fines or penalties. We think
          itâ€™s great you had the guts to try something new.
        </p>
        <h3>ðŸ‘‰ taking the highway.</h3>
        <p>
          If you want to move forward, youâ€™ll start a paid traineeship at an
          organization. Youâ€™ll work 4 days a week and focus on learning for 1
          day. Personal coaching supports you in your new career.

        <h2>Whatâ€™s your next career?</h2>
        <h3>Creative Front-end Development - start March 2020</h3>
        <p>
          If you like creating things,
          <a
            href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html"
            >front-end development may be for you</a
          >. Itâ€™s easy to learn. Sureâ€”youâ€™ll have to put in the hours, but itâ€™s
          one of those skills that will give you immediate gratification: you
          see what you build.
          <br />
          Itâ€™s also high in demand, low in supply. This means: a good salary,
          easy to land a job, and a quick road to a permanent position (if
          thatâ€™s what you desire).
          <br />
          Front-end development is also highly flexible, which means you can
          arrange your work around the things that are important to you.
        </p>
        <a href="https://www.noahroad.nl/#contact">Sounds good. I'm in!</a>
        <h3>Data storytelling - start January 2020</h3>
        <p>
          Do you enjoy creativity Ã¡nd technology? As a data storyteller you can
          do both: being creative by visualizing and technological by working
          with data. You will be the person that gives data driven
          recommendations to the business users in your organization.
          <br />
          The paid traineeship will take 2 years, starting with 3 months of
          intense training.
          <br />
          During this traineeship we will work on your soft skills (Scrum,
          Presentation Skills, etc.) and hard skills (SQL, Tableau, etc.)
        </p>
        <a href="#">I'm interested in one of these tracks.</a>
        <h3>Creative Learning Development - ongoing</h3>
        <p>
          Learning developers have a passion for instructions and technology.
          How do you make impactful trainings to serve organization goals. And
          how can technology work for a company? All presented in a
          comprehensible way so that employees can learn from it.
          <br />
          In this track, you start immediately as a trainee working for a
          company. You are guided by senior learning strategists that will train
          you in the necessary hard skills and soft skills.

          in your own future. These people have traveled before you. They were
          consultants, sales people, engineers, students, project managers. (<a
